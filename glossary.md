# Area Spell

Sphere centered on target with radius = Force meters. Affects friendly or otherwise.

# Astral Detection

* To detect when an astral form passes through their aura, make a Perception + Intuition (4) [Mental] Test

# Astral Limit

Your Mental or Social limit, whichever is greater.

Page 278

# Astral Perception

* With Assensing, you can interpret the “colors” and “brightness” of an aura to determine the wellness and state of being of the subject. 
* Can interact with astral objects/combat.
* While trying to accomplish mundane tasks; –2 dice pool penalty to actions on the physical plane.
* To learn more about an aura, you may make a Simple Assensing + Intuition [Astral] Test
    * Num of hits = how much you learn.
* Can get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, ritual, spirit, living creature, foreboding horror from beyond all mortal ken, etc.).
* Don’t need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious.
* Non living objects can pick up impressions for a limited time from being in contact with living auras. 
    * A teddy bear in the Barrens might pick up a child’s fear, a wedding ring its owner’s sense of love and joy, or a murder weapon an aura of rage. 
* Impressions are vague and fleeting, but you don’t need to assense the object to get them.

# Astral Plane

It is an emotionally charged photonegative of the physical world where only living things and things infused with mana are real and physical objects are mere intangible shadows.

* Entities with tangible Forms
    * Spirits, active foci, dual-natured beings, etc.

# Astral Projection
    
* Consciousness is contained in an astral form, and can leave your corporeal body.
* Can travel around the astral plane at great speeds unimpeded by material objects such as walls, floors, and burly goons (unless they are dual-natured).
* Body is in a coma-like state while your astral body is out in the aether.
* Your mind and body are still connected, so any damage taken to body or mind is felt by both. 
* Only full Magicians can astrally project.
* Movement
    * Imagine himself at a place and his astral body travels there.
        * Nearby places can be reached in seconds, minutes for locations on the same continent
        * Hours to get anywhere on the globe.
    * When targeting
        * 100 meters each Combat Turn (Astral Walking rate). 
        * 5 kilometers per Combat Turn (Astral running rate, normal penalties to actions for Running apply.
    * Astral forms can move in any direction—they
    * Limit: Earthly atmosphere (about eighty kilometers up), death after.

* Manifesting
    * Psychic effect that lets you make yourself visible and audible on the physical plane through an act of will. 
    * Complex Action to engage/disengage.
    * Appear on the physical plane as a ghostly, hazy image of your astral form and may freely communicate with physical characters.

        * Can’t cast spells on targets on the physical plane. 
        * Technological devices can’t detect or record you.
        * Magic Rating x 5 minutes per astral projection session.
* Staying
    * Use hours = Magic x 2
    * If longer, your astral being ceases to exist and your body dies.
    * If return to your body, this clock stops, but it doesn’t reset until you’ve spent at least as long in your body as you spent out of it.

# Astral Signature

* Produced when magicians cast a spell or perform a ritual.
* Produced on anything affected by magic skills or abilities.
* Can be detected by anyone with the assensing skill. 
* Lasts # hours = magical effect’s Force after the effect
* Where it was cast and where it took effect.
* Semi-permanent objects such as alchemical preparations and watchers while they last. 
* Foci, lodges, and circles always contain the astral signature of their owner.
* Assensing
    *  Assensing + Intuition [Astral] test.
    * On success, a signature can be recognized again, possibly with a Memory Test
    * Other details such as the general class of spell or spirit, or the skill of the magician, can be determined with net hits
* Complex Action: to reduce the amount of time it takes for the signature to fade by 1 hour, can stack

# Inherent Limit: Astral

= Mental/Social limit, whichever is greater.

# Initiation

Page 324

# Learning Spells

Learned by studying spell formulae or finding some mentor (either a spirit or another Awakened individual) to teach you. 

There are online communities such as SpellSource and Magiknet that hold collections of formulae submitted from various traditions. These networks are generally supported by one or more corporations, meaning that in order to use it, you’ll need have a legal SIN and a license to practice magic. 

If you want a living, breathing teacher, they usually charge around (Instruction skill x formula cost) in nuyen—expensive, but usually worth every bit of the jing you spend. Either way, you’ll need a magical lodge of your own tradition.

Make a Learning Test: a Simple (Spellcasting, Ritual Spellcasting, or Alchemy) + Intuition [magical lodge’s Force] Test.

Time requied = 12 days / number of hits you get. 

If you have a teacher, he or she can make an Instruction Test (p. 141) to add extra dice to your Learning Test. 

At the end of the study time, spend 5 Karma to learn the spell, ritual, 
or alchemical preparation.

If your formula or teacher is of a different tradition than you, you take a –4 penalty to the Learning Test.

While learning the spell, you must devote eight hours of each day to learning the spell, otherwise you fail and must start all over. If you get no hits on the Learning Test, you fail. If you do end up failing, no Karma is spent, but any money you spent on instruction is gone.

# Ritual Spellcasting

Performed by 1 person or group

1. Choose Ritual Leader
    * Leader must know spell
    * Participants don't need to know spell
    * All effects have leader's astral signature
    * Each participant with different tradition than the leader: -2 dice for all actions for ritual
2. Choose Ritual
3. Choose the Force of the Ritual Spell
4. Set up the Foundation
    * Lodge Force >= Force of the ritual.
    * If any participants (sans Spotter) leave lodge, spell fails.
5. Give the Offering
    * Leader expends reagents equal to Force of the ritual
    * Leader may expend more reagents to reduce Drain when sealing the spell.
    * For every (Force) drams of reagents spent (after initial offering), the Drain value is reduced by 1, to min 2.
Even if you’re not spending reagents, you’ll still be spending a little time on this step making the foundation ready for the ritual.
6. Perform the Ritual
7. Seal the Ritual
    * Leader makes a Ritual Spellcasting + Magic [Force] vs (Force x 2) test, with a Teamwork test from each of the participants. 
    * Each participant also takes Drain = 2x number of hits on the defense side of the Ritual Spellcasting Test (min 2). 
    * If the number of hits the leader got on her Teamwork Test was higher than her Magic rating, this drain is Physical; otherwise it’s Stun.

* Failure
    * Make a Force x 2 test; the Drain is equal to twice the number of hits on this test in Stun damage to all participants. Any reagents you’ve already spent in Step 5 are wasted
* Glitches
    * Options:
        * +2 Drain (e.g.,+2 Drain Value)
        * +2 to the Force resisting completion of the spell
        * The leader being forced to seal the ritual on his own.
* Critical Glitch 
    * Anything goes, options:
        * Put down the minion
        * Missed target
        * Find that what you intended to be a healing circle really is an astral gateway and everybody just got dumped on some metaplane

# Rituals

Learn each ritual the same way you learn a spell.

* Anchored
    * Must be placed on a physical object or symbol of mystical significance that serves as the ritual’s focal point.

* Material Link
    * Something that is an integral part of the target of a Ritual.
    * Living: tissue sample
        * Hair, blood and other bodily fluids, nail clippings, and so on are viable for a few hours
        * Finger or larger tissue samples can last a few days before the being’s aura fades too much
        * Chemical preservation methods instantly destroy the sample’s viability as a material link
        * Samples can be frozen for later use
    * Non-living: Link has to be something that is an essential part of the object’s structure.

    * Spotter must be present in the ritual’s foundation when the ritual begins and then must travel physically or astrally to where she can assense the target of the spell
    * The target does not have to be astrally active the spotter must be able to assense him to establish the necessary mystic link.
    * If the spell is an area spell, the spotter must be able to assense the target location. 
    * For the duration of the ritual, a link is present between the spotter’s astral form and the ritual group.
